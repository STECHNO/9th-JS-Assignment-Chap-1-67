        <p id="para">An ion thruster ionizes  propellant by adding or removing electrons to produce ions. 
            Most thrusters ionize propellant by electron bombardment: a high-energy electron (negative charge) 
            collides with a propellant atom (neutral charge), releasing electrons from the propellant atom and 
            resulting in a positively charged ion. The  gas  produced  consists  of positive ions and negative 
            electrons in proportions that result in no over-all electric charge. This is called a plasma. 
            Plasma has some of the properties of a gas, but it is affected by electric and magnetic fields. 
            Common examples are lightning and the substance inside fluorescent light bulbs.</p>
